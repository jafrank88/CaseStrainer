        "syllabus": "<p>A combination of a dominant proportion of the dealers in fresh meat throughout the United States, not to bid against, or only in conjunction with, each other in order to regulate prices in and induce shipments to the live stock markets in other States, to restrict shipments, establish uniform rules of credit, make uniform and improper rules of cartage, and to get less than lawful rates from railroads to the exclusion of competitors with intent to monopolize commerce among the States, is an illegal combination within the meaning and prohibition of the act of July 2, 1890, 26 Stat. 209, and can be restrained and enjoined in an action by the United States.</p> <p>It does not matter that a combination of this nature embraces restraint and monopoly of trade within a single State if it also embraces and is directed against commerce among the States. Moreover the effect of such a combination upon interstate commerce is direct and not accidental, secondary or remote as in United Stales v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1.</p> <p>Even if the separate elements of such a scheme are lawful, when they are bound.together by a common intent as parts of an unlawful scheme to monopolize interstate commerce the plan may make the parts unlawful.</p> <p>When cattle are sent for sale from a place in one State, with the expectation they will end their transit, after purchase, in another State, and when in effect they do so, with only the interruption necessary to find a purchaser at the stock yards, and when this is a constantly recurring course, it constitutes interstate commerce and the purchase of the cattle is an incident of such commerce.</p> <p>A bill in equity, and the demurrer thereto, are n\u00e9ither of them to be read and construed strictly as an indictment but are to be taken to mean what they fairly convey to a dispassionate reader by a- fairly exact use of English speech.</p>",

        "summary": "<p>APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.</p> <p>The facts are stated in the opinion.</p> <p>The charges in each of the paragraphs or counts of the bill or petition of alleged violations of the Sherman Act are, respectively, mere statements of legal conclusions. Each is bad on demurrer for that reason.</p> <p>These' charges would be bad on that ground, even in an indictment under this act. In re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104; United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 563; United States v. Simmons, 96 U. S. 360; United States v. Carll, 105 U. S. 611; United States v. Britton, 107 U. S. 655; Hazard v. Griswold, 21 Fed. Rep. 178. And a fortiori are they bad in a bill or petition in equity, which is required to state the facts essential to the cause of action. Lawson v. Hewell, 118 California, 613; Wright v. Dame, 22 Pick. 59; Ambler v. Choteau, 107 TJ. S. 586; Van Weel v. Winston, 115 U. S. 228, 237; 1 Foster Fed. Prac. \u00a7 67.</p> <p>The facts alleged are looked at and riot adjectives or adverbs or epithets. Magniac v. Thompson, 2 Wall. Jr. 209; Price v. Coleman, 21 Fed. Rep. 357; Van Weel v. Winston, and Ambler v. Choteau, supra.</p> <p>The importance of applying this rule with strictness here is more marked because answer by the defendants under oath is called for. This point is properly raised by demurrer. 1 Daniel Ch. Pr. 372. It was so raised in Van Weel v. Winston, supra.</p> <p>The decree complained of, which is merely one of injunction, is erroneous on like grounds of indefiniteness. Laurie v; Laurje, 9 Paige, 234, 235; Robinson v. Clapp, 65 Connecticut, 365; Whipple v. Hutchinson, 4 Blatchf. 190.</p> <p>It makes clear the misconception of the Sherman Act and of Federal power to regulate commerce upon which the bill and. decree proceed. They appear to go upon the theory that Under the act of Congress the Federal courts'are to regulate commerce, and the decree enjoins, not specific acts, but violations of the statute in terms as general as the act of Congress itself. A defendant cannot know from its terms what he may or may not do without making himself liable as in contempt.</p> <p>This makes the insufficiency of the bill more obvious, as no valid decree could have been entered upon its allegations.</p> <p>The provisions of the Sherman- Act do not contemplate such a general proceeding or decree to interfere in advance with future dealings, as interstate commerce, which may be interstate trade or may be domestic trade according to the future and changeable intention of the dealers. United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1, 15.</p> <p>The business of defendants of purchasing live stock and of selling fresh meats produced therefrom, as described in the bill, is not, upon the allegations of fact in the bill, interstate or foreign commerce.</p> <p>The purchase of cattle as alleged and described in the first paragraph of the bill is not alleged Or shown to be interstate commerce.</p> <p>The busin\u00e9ss of defendants of selling such fresh meats, at the several places where they are so prepared, as described in the second paragraph, is not, under the facts there alleged, interstate trade or commerce. The sales and deliveries, although to dealers in other States and Territories, are there alleged to be made at the places where the meats are prepared by defend-. ants, and are domestic sales:</p> <p>. The deliveries by defendants to the carriers, who are agents of the purchasers in that respect, under the allegations of the bill, are deliveries to the purchasers in the State where'the sale is made; and the sales.and deliveries are there fully completed. Merchant v. Chapman, 4 Allen, 362; Orcutt v. Nelson, 1. Gray, 543; Waldron v. Bomaine, 22 N. Y. 368; Ramsey & Gore Co. v. Kelsea, 55 N. J. L. 320; Cotte v. Harden, 4 E\u00e1st. 211; Brown v. Hodgson, 2 Camp. 86; Growing v. Needham, 5 Maul\u00e9 & S. 189; 2 Kent. Com. 499; Crossman v. Lurman, 192 U. S. 189, 198.</p> <p>The sellers\u2019 act in delivering the merchandise to the common .carrier, or carrying the merchandise to -the carrier\u2019s depot (if' that is taken to be in effect alleged), is not any part' of the interstate transportation, and does not make the goods the subject of interstate commerce. Coe v. Errol, 116 U. S. 517, 528:</p> <p>The fact that the sale is made with a view to the goods being transported by the buyer\u2019s agent to another State after the sale and delivery is fully completed, does not make the sale interstate commerce.</p> <p>The sales alleged in the third paragraph of the bill, by agents of the owners in other States and Territories to whom the owners of the fresh meats have shipped the same for sale there by such agents on the ground, are not incidents of interstate commerce. Coe v. Errol, 116 U. S. 517, 525; Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U. S. 1, 23; United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1, 13, 17; Austin v. Tennessee, 179 U. S. 343; Crossman v. Lurman, 192 U. S. 189, 198; Am. Harrow Co. v. Shaffer, 58 Fed. Rep. 750; Stevens v. Ohio, 93 Fed, Rep. 793.</p> <p>Under the allegations herein question, it is to be taken that' the meats, before the sales here referred to are made, have come to their place of rest and are at rest for an indefinite time awaiting sale at their place of destination, and are a commodity in the market where the sales are made; and that the sales are not in the \"original packages\u201d; and that the meats, at the time of the sales, have become a 'part of the general property, in the State where .sold, and are there handled and sold as such.' \u25a0Southern Coal,Co. v. Bates, 156 U. S-. 577, 588; Brown v\u201e Houston, 114 U. S. 623, Q32;Emert v. Missouri, 156 U. S. 296, 310; Singer Mfg. Co. v. Wright, 97 Gdorgia, 123.</p> <p>The point here made is entirely consistent with the rulings in many cases, that the owner of merchandise, tvho transports it from one State to another for sale, has a right (which cannot be interfered with by state or municipal laws) to sell it as an article of interstate commerce. He also has a right to make such article part of the general property of the State into which it is taken, and he then has the right to sell and others have the right to purchase it as an article of domestic commerce, which cannot be interfered with- by Federal law. The Sherman Act does not seek-to and could not interfere with that right. United States v. E. C. Knight Co.,. 156 U. S. 1,15, and Kidd v. Pearson and Veazie v. Moor, there cited. But this bill here does seek to interfere with that right. Again, the point here made is not touched by the line of decisions holding that state or municipal laws are invalid, which, by taxation or other regulations, discriminate against merchandise brought from another State, or seek to prevent interstate commerce therein, \u2014such as Welton v. Missouri, 91 U. S. 465; Walling v. Michigan, 116 U. S. 446; Minnesota v. Barber, 136 U. S. 313; Brimmer v. Rebman, 138 U. S. 78, and Schollenberger v. Pennsylvania, 171 U. S. 1, 24, 25.</p> <p>The bill of complaint does not show any contract,, combination or conspiracy in restraint of interstate trade or commerce within the meaning 'of the Sherman Act.</p> <p>It does not allege any acts of defendants monopolizing or attempting to monopolize or combining or conspiring to monopoliz\u00f3 such trade or commerce.</p> <p>If the act in question be given a construction which would sustain this bill of - complaint, the statute would be unconstitutional.</p> <p>The alleged offenses complained of are set forth in the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, t\u00e9nth and eleventh paragraphs of the bill. As to the sixth and seventh paragraphs w\u00e9 maintain: The allegations of combination and conspiracy here are of mere legal conclusions. That the purchases of live stock referred to in the sixth and seventh paragraphs, as therein allegedi are not interstate commerce.</p> <p>The first paragraph of the bill in which the business of purchasing live stock for slaughter is set forth and described, does-not allege or show that the business is interstate commerce.</p> <p>The description of the. live stock in the sixth paragraph, as live stock produced and owned principally in other States and Territories, and shipped by the owners to the places where sold, for sale to persons engaged- in producing and dealing in fresh meat, does not show that the sales of, the live stock are interstate commerce. The live stock, when offered for sale in the pens of the stock yards, are, under the allegations of -fact in the bill,- to be considered as having become part of the general mass of property of the State where offered for sale. The defendants purchasing the live stock have th\u00e9 right so to treat and deal therewith. JBrown v. Houston, 114 U. S. 622, 632; Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Bates, 156 U. S. 577, 588, 589; Emert v. Missouri, 120 U. S. 489, 497: When purchased, the live stock is, under the allegations of this bill, at rest for- an indefinite time, awaiting sale at its place of destination.' Diamond Match Co. v. Ontonagon, 188 U. -S. 82, 92.</p> <p>The defendants have as much right, then, to treat and deal with and purchase such live stock as-an article of domestic commerc\u00e9 as the State has so to treat it for the purposes of taxation or regulation. . This bill seeks to interfere with that right under the Sherman Act.</p> <p>If the sworn allegations of the bill in this respect were to be supplemented by other facts, as matters of common knowledge/ with respect to the situation of the live stock when sold, such as appeared in the Hopkins and Anderson cases, the case of the Government would be no better. It Would then appear that the cattle and other live, stock are shipped to 'commission merchants at the stock yards;-are then placed in the pens of the stock yards companies, and there held, cared for and fed by the stock yards company for the account of the commission merchants, and under the .allegations here it must be taken that their bulk is broken up; they are divided into lots and sold and delivered by the commission merchant as the principal or owner thereof, and so are not purchased as articles of interstate commerce.</p> <p>But if these purchases of live stock are interstate commerce, the acts alleged in the sixth and seventh paragraphs are not violations of the Sherman Act. Hopkins v. United States, 171 U. S. 591; Anderson v. United States, 171 U. S. 604. They are the exercise of a' constitutional right of defendants to control their own business.</p> <p>There is nothing in the bill to show the proportion of the entire number of head of live stock offered for sale at the markets in question, which is bought by the defendants for the purposes of the production of fresh meat; and so there is.nothing to show anything like monopoly or attempt at monopoly of the live stock purchases by the defendants.</p> <p>There is nothing in the bill to show any attempt on the part of the defendants to control or affect the purchases or business in the purchases of live stock of any other persons than themselves. The alleged combinations by defendants in the sixth and seventh paragraphs charged have to do merely with their own business conduct in themselves buying live stock, or determining how much they shall buy, at private sale for consumption in their own' private business.</p> <p>The combination charged in the sixth paragraph, for directing their respective purchasing agents \u201cto refrain from bidding against each other, except perfunctorily, and without good faith,\u201d does not allege a combination to restrain trade; or even a combination to refrain from bidding. A perfunctory bid, made without good faith, is one which the seller could accept and enforce.</p> <p>The alleged combination in \"the seventh paragraph, \u201cfor bidding up, through their respective purchasing agents, the prices of live stock for a few days at a time at the said stock yards and open markets,\u201d does not charge a.combination to restrain trade.</p> <p>These alleged combinations do not have the direct and immediate effect of restraining interstate commerce, but their effect, if any, upon interstate trade in live stock is i\u00f1direct and incidental, within the meaning of the decisions of this court. The effect is not near so direct or immediate as the mutual agreement of the traders who were members of the Traders\u2019 Exchange in the Anderson case.</p> <p>Obviously the supply of live stock for fresh meat greatly varies in the market at different seasons and times, while the demand for fresh meats for human consumption, for which defendants purchase such live stock, is comparatively constant and uniform.</p> <p>It is a public benefit and not a public evil that defendants should always be able to supply such constant demand for their fresh, meats, and that at the same time they should not overstock the market with their perishable meats. This makes it proper that they should act with some concert and common understanding in their purchases of live stock for that purpose.</p> <p>As to the eighth paragraph we contend: The allegation of combination and conspiracy is of a mere legal conclusion, and insufficient. The sales of 'fresh meats by agents of defendants, ' as there described, under the facts alleged, are not interstate commerce. But if it be interstate commerce, no violation of the Sherman Act is thereby shown.</p> <p>No criminal conspiracy is alleged. The charge there is not of a combination or conspiracy to restrain trade (which the statute forbids), but is of a combination or conspiracy to do a lawful act, the exercise of a constitutional right, viz: to raise, lower, fix and maintain their own prices, for their own property, in private sales thereof by' themselves. The doing that is not prohibited or made criminal by the, Act of Congress.</p> <p>A criminal conspiracy is an agreement of two or more, either to do an act criminal or unlawful in itself, or to do a lawful act by means which are criminal or unlawful. Pettibone v. United States, 148 U. S. 203; Commonwealth v. Shedd, 7 Cush. 514. Here neither the act nor the means alleged are criminal or unlawful. The allegation of intent is immaterial. Stevenson v. Newham, 13 C. B. 285; Allen v. Flood, App. Cas: 1.</p> <p>Again, this point is settled , by the ruling in the Knight Case, 156 U. S. 1,16, that the restraint of trade, if any, which a combination by defendants to raise or lower their own prices would tend to effect would be.an indirect result, and such result would not necessarily determine the object of the contract, combination or conspiracy.</p> <p>As to the ninth paragraph we contend: The allegation is of a conclusion of law. The cartage as there described is not, under the allegations of the bill, interstate commerce. State v. Knight, 192 U. 8.1,21 \u00a1Detroit cfee. Ry. v. Interstate Comm. Com., 74 Fed. Rep. 803, 808; Hopkins v. United States, 171 U. S. 578, 592. The charge is not of \u00e1 conspiracy either to do a criminal or unlawful act, or to do by unlawful means the lawful act of fixing their own charges for cartage. Nothing here charged has the direct, immediate or necessary effect to restrain interstate*commerce.</p> <p>As to the tenth paragraph we maintain: The allegation is of a legal conclusion. It also is too-indefinite and general. Sufficient facts are not alleged. United States v. Hanley, 71 Fed. Rep. 672.</p> <p>\u00c1 contract or combination among manufacturers or producers of an article which is intended to become the subject of interstate commerce, to raise, lower and fix prices of such article, is not necessarily a' contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of interstate trade or an attempt to monopolize that trade under the Sherman Act. United States v. Nelson, 52 Fed. Rep. 646; In re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104; United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1, 16; Gibbs.v. McNeeley, 102 Fed. Rep. 504. See also Distillery Co. v. People, 156 Illinois, 468; Glucose Company v. Harding, 182 Illinois, 551.</p> <p>There was no jurisdiction herein of this charge. IN o common contract, combination or conspiracy of the defendants with each other is alleged. The allegation that \u201call and each\u201d have made agreements for less than lawful transportation rates is that they did so acting separately. That was not unlawful on the part of the defendants; much less was it any violation of the Sherman Anti Trust Act. There is here no sufficient .showing of an attempt to monopolize either the interstate transportation of live stock or fresh meats or interstate trade in live stock or fresh meats. The -paragraph is multifarious, and there is therein a-misjoinder of causes and parties.</p> <p>As to the eleventh paragraph we submit that it is too general and insufficient to require argument. It is disposed of by what has been urged as to previous paragraphs.</p> <p>Prior rulings by this court in cases arising under the Sherman Act do not sustain the Government\u2019s case here.</p> <p>With respect to the supposed limitations of the Sherman Act upon the right of private contract, that act is to be interpreted in the light of the principles of.'the common law. United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649; Moore v. United States, 91 U. S. 270, 274; Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162; Ex'parte Wilson, 114 U. S. 417, 422; Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 624; Smith v. Alabama, 124 U. S. 465.\u2019</p> <p>The bill of complaint is multifarious; and there is therein a. misjoinder of causes and of parties. Walker v. Powers., 104 U. S. 251; Brown v. Guarantee Trust Company, 128 TJ. S. 403; Zeigler v. Lake Street Railway, 76 Fed. Rep. 662.</p> <p>The bill is too general and indefinite to require answer. It does not sufficiently set forth definite or specific facts.</p> <p>The demurrers to so much of the bill as prays for answer under oath, and to so much thereof .as prays discovery of defendants\u2019 books, papers, etc.,- are well taken. -</p> <p>Rights protected by' the Fourth and Fifth Amendments are thereby infringed. United States v. Saline Bank, 1 Pet. 100; Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616; Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547; Livingston v. Tompkins, 4 Johns. Ch. 415, 432; Entick v.

Pldg. 289. . \u2022</p> <p>The facts show a combination which restrains or monopolizes trade or commerce and operates upon and directly affects interstate or. foreign trade or commerce.</p> <p>The combination\u00bb, or conspiracy which the Government is seeking to destroy and which it was the aim of the petition in this case to set forth is one between all the principal American producers or packers of fresh meats for the purpose of jointly controlling the market for those products throughout the entire United States so as to maintain Uniform prices therefor and destroy competition in the sale thereof to .dealers and consumers.</p> <p>The combination set forth in the bill is in restraint of traded for if in. the entire field of the law concerning monopolies and restraints of trade there is a single proposition to which -all courts now yield assent, it is that a combination, conspiracy, or agreement between independent manufacturers or producers of a necessary of life to fix and maintain uniform prices for their products, or otherwise to suppress competition with each other, is an unlawful restraint upon trade.

Mc-Conoughby, 79 Illinois, 346; Noyes on Intercorporate Relations, p. 513, note 1, and see the cases collected; and necessarily the means agreed upon to effect'the unlawful object of the combination of conspiracy are inseparable parts of the combination or conspiracy itself, and along with it fall within the condemnation of the law.</p> <p>The combination or conspiracy in controversy operates upon interstate or foreign commerce, and its operations are not confined to commerce carried on wholly within state lines.</p> <p>The sales of live stock to the defendants and the sales by them of the prepared meats are interstate and not intrastate transactions,.</p> <p>As to what is interstate commerce, see Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 194; Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U. S. 197, 337. If interstate commerce is commerce which concerns more States than one, and if a combination of independent producers to suppress competition between its members is a restraint upon commerce, it must follow that a combination of independent producers to fix and control- prices and suppress- competition between each other in an area covering more States than one is in .restraint of interstate commerce and the petition in this case discloses such a combination.</p> <p>\u25a0 It is impossible to say with even a color of reason that the facts stated in the bill, which cannot be denied, do not show a combination between the defendants to suppress competition between themselves in an area embracing more States than one and it is immaterial to inquire whether the particular purchases and sales made by the defendants are, technically, interstate or intrastate transactions. There is nothing unreasonable or novel in the conclusion that a combination may restrain interstate commerce, although the individual transactions. of its members might, standing alone and viewed separate and apart from the purpose and necessary effect of the whole combination, be intrastate in character. Montague & Co. v. Lomy, 193 U. S. 38.- The character of a combination \u2022 \u2014that is, whether or not it is interstate in its operation- \u2014 is decided, not by the nature of the particular transactions of its individual members, but by the extent of- the territory in which it operates \u2014 in which it controls prices and sales and suppresses competition. If that territory embraces more States than one the combination restrains interstate commerce.' Addyston .Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, 175 U. S. 211, 240.</p> <p>Whether a combination in restraint of trade operates upon interstate or only intrastate commerce does not depend ppon whether the individual transactions of its members, standing alone and viewed separate and apart from the purpose and necessary effect of- the whole combination, are interstate or intrastate in character, and the petition here discloses a combination which operates upon interstate commerce; for whatever may be the character of the individual transactions of its several members, it is also true in this case that the individual -transactions of the members of the combination do fall within the jurisdiction conferred upon Congress by the commerce clause of the Constitution. These transactions consist of the defendants\u2019 purchases of live stock; the sales and shipments of fresh meats made directly \u2022by'1 the defendants to dealers and consumers in the several States, and the sales of fresh meats to dealers and consumers in the several States by agents of the defendants located in those States.</p> <p>From all over the stock-raising section, embracing many different States, cattle, sheep and hogs are habitually shipped to the great live-stock markets at Chicago, Omaha, Sioux City, St. Joseph, Kansas City, East St. Louis and St. Paul for sale, to those, the defendants chief among th\u00e9m, engaged in the business of converting live stock into fresh meats for human consumption. The shipments are made with the express'and' sole purpose of sale as soon as market conditions will permit, and the sales are made while the cattle yet remain in first hands, that is,. in the hands of the owners or th'eir agents, and in the ordinary form or condition in which cattle are shipped from one country or State to another, which is analogous to the form or condition of the original package in the case of merchandise. Austin vi Tennessee, 179 U. S. 343, '359.</p> <p>The cattle are not dealt with in a commercial way from the time of their arrival until their sale to the defendants and others, but are simply fed and cared for. No act is done with reference to them that would cause them to become mixed with the general mass of local property. Now, it may be that a distinction should be made between what may be called an interstate-sale proper, and in the full sense of the term \u2014 that is, a sale between persons negotiating and dealing from two or more different States, and a sale, at its destination and while it still remains in the original state or package, of an article of commerce sent from another State. But so far as the result in this instance is concerned it is a distinction without a difference. If the sales of live stock set forth in the petition do not fall within the first of these classes they certainly fall within the second, and that brings them within the protection of the Federal power over commerce and therefore within the protection of the Anti Trust Act; for the right to transport articles of commerce from one State to another includes the right of the owner or consignee to sell them in\u2019 the latter free from any burden or restraint that the States might attempt to impose.

S. 578, 590.</p> <p>Paragraph 2 of the bill contains matter of description and inducement, and must be read in conjunction with the stating part of the petition, which alleges, inter alia, that \u201cin order to restrain and destroy competition- among themselves \u201d the defendants have engaged in a \u201ccombination and conspiracy to arbitrarily from time to time raise, lower, and fix prices, and to maintain uniform prices at which they will sell, directly or through their respective agents; such fresh meats to dealers and consumers throughout the said States and Territories and the District of Columbia and foreign countries.\u201d</p> <p>As the sales made directly by the defendants to dealers and consumers throughout the United States are interstate sales, and as decisions of this' court have settled that a combination to control and suppress competition in such sales is a combination in restraint of interstate commerce, the petition in this case, having shown that much, cannot in any event be dismissed, even should it be held to have failed in all other respects.</p> <p>Paragraph 3 of the petition states that the defendants are engaged in shipping fresh meats from their plants in certain States to their respective agents at and. near the principal markets in other States and Territories for sale by such agents to dealers and consumers in those States and Territories. Upon the question whether or not the' sales made by these agents under the circumstances set forth are within the body of interstate commerce, there is nothing to add to the cogent argument in the opinion of the circuit judge.</p> <p>The bill is not multifarious and does not disclose a mis-joinder of parties. 14 Ency. of PL and Pr. 198; 1 Bates Fed. Eq. Pro. \u00a7\u00a7 135, 195. The Circuit Court did not err in sustaining the demurrers to the bill in its aspect as a bill of discovery. The demurrers are demurrers to the whole bill. Livingston v. Story, 9 Pet. 632, 654.</p> <p>The well-settled rule of equity pleading is that a demurrer to a whole bill cannot be sustained as to part of the bill and overruled as to part, but must be overruled as to the whole if any part \u00f3f the bill is good and entitles the complainant to any relief. Fletcher, Eq. PL \u00a7\u00a7 203, 204; Story, Eq. PL, 10th ed., \u00a7\u00a7 443, 444; Parker v. Simpson, 62 N. E. Rep. (Mass.) 401; Metier\u2019s Admn\u2019s. v. Metier, 18 N. J. Eq. 270, 273. When the defendants leveled their demurrers at the relief as well as the discovery, instead of answering as to the relief and demurring as to the discovery they did so at their p\u00e9ril. Daniell\u2019s Chari. Prat\u00ed., 3d Am. ed., 568-608; see also Acts of Congress of'February 25, 1903, 32 Stat. 903; of February 11, 1893, 27 Stat. 443, and Interstate Comm. Com. v. Baird, 194 U. S. 25, 44, citing Brown v. Walker', 161 U. S. 591; Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616.</p> <p>Judges have differed as to the validity of aggregations of capital effected by some form of organic union between several smaller and competing corporations, and economists are far from agreeing that such aggregations, within limitations, are hurtful. So- too, associations of manufacturers to regulate competition within a restricted area have not always been condemned by courts and have sometimes been approved by publicists. But as yet no responsible voice has been heard to justify, legally or economically, a conspiracy or agreement between nearly all the producers of a commodity necessary to life by which the confederates acquire absolute control and dominion over the production, sale and distribution of that commodity throughout the entire territory of a nation, with the power, at will, to raise prices to the consumer of'the finished product and lower prices to the- producer of the raw material. Yet such is that now at the bar of this court. That there is a conspiracy to control the market of the nation for fresh meats, that it does control it, and that its control is merciless and oppressive, are. facts known of all men. The broad question here is, Does the Government\u2019s petition, with its statements of fact standing unchallenged, discover that conspiracy to the court? We submit that it does and that the decree of the Circuit Court should in all things be affirmed.</p>",

So- too, associations of manufacturers to regulate competition within a restricted area have not always been condemned by courts and have sometimes been approved by publicists. But as yet no responsible voice has been heard to justify, legally or economically, a conspiracy or agreement between nearly all the producers of a commodity necessary to life by which the confederates acquire absolute control and dominion over the production, sale and distribution of that commodity throughout the entire territory of a nation, with the power, at will, to raise prices to the consumer of'the finished product and lower prices to the- producer of the raw material. Yet such is that now at the bar of this court. That there is a conspiracy to control the market of the nation for fresh meats, that it does control it, and that its control is merciless and oppressive, are. facts known of all men. The broad question here is, Does the Government\u2019s petition, with its statements of fact standing unchallenged, discover that conspiracy to the court? We submit that it does and that the decree of the Circuit Court should in all things be affirmed.\n   </summary>"

Moreover the effect of such a combination upon interstate commerce is direct and not accidental, secondary or remote as in United Stales v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U.

Each is bad on demurrer for that reason.</p> <p>These' charges would be bad on that ground, even in an indictment under this act. In re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104; United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 563; United States v. Simmons, 96 U. S. 360; United States v. Carll, 105 U. S. 611; United States v. Britton, 107 U. S. 655; Hazard v. Griswold, 21 Fed. Rep. 178. And a fortiori are they bad in a bill or petition in equity, which is required to state the facts essential to the cause of action. Lawson v. Hewell, 118 California, 613; Wright v. Dame, 22 Pick. 59; Ambler v. Choteau, 107 TJ. S. 586; Van Weel v. Winston, 115 U. S. 228, 237; 1 Foster Fed. Prac. \u00a7 67.</p> <p>The facts alleged are looked at and riot adjectives or adverbs or epithets. Magniac v. Thompson, 2 Wall. Jr. 209; Price v. Coleman, 21 Fed. Rep. 357; Van Weel v. Winston, and Ambler v. Choteau, supra.</p> <p>The importance of applying this rule with strictness here is more marked because answer by the defendants under oath is called for. This point is properly raised by demurrer. 1 Daniel Ch. Pr. 372. It was so raised in Van Weel v. Winston, supra.</p> <p>The decree complained of, which is merely one of injunction, is erroneous on like grounds of indefiniteness. Laurie v; Laurje, 9 Paige, 234, 235; Robinson v. Clapp, 65 Connecticut, 365; Whipple v. Hutchinson, 4 Blatchf. 190.</p> <p>It makes clear the misconception of the Sherman Act and of Federal power to regulate commerce upon which the bill and. decree proceed. They appear to go upon the theory that Under the act of Congress the Federal courts'are to regulate commerce, and the decree enjoins, not specific acts, but violations of the statute in terms as general as the act of Congress itself. A defendant cannot know from its terms what he may or may not do without making himself liable as in contempt.</p> <p>This makes the insufficiency of the bill more obvious, as no valid decree could have been entered upon its allegations.</p> <p>The provisions of the Sherman- Act do not contemplate such a general proceeding or decree to interfere in advance with future dealings, as interstate commerce, which may be interstate trade or may be domestic trade according to the future and changeable intention of the dealers. United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1, 15.</p> <p>The business of defendants of purchasing live stock and of selling fresh meats produced therefrom, as described in the bill, is not, upon the allegations of fact in the bill, interstate or foreign commerce.</p> <p>The purchase of cattle as alleged and described in the first paragraph of the bill is not alleged Or shown to be interstate commerce.</p> <p>The busin\u00e9ss of defendants of selling such fresh meats, at the several places where they are so prepared, as described in the second paragraph, is not, under the facts there alleged, interstate trade or commerce. The sales and deliveries, although to dealers in other States and Territories, are there alleged to be made at the places where the meats are prepared by defend-. ants, and are domestic sales:</p> <p>. The deliveries by defendants to the carriers, who are agents of the purchasers in that respect, under the allegations of the bill, are deliveries to the purchasers in the State where'the sale is made; and the sales.and deliveries are there fully completed. Merchant v. Chapman, 4 Allen, 362; Orcutt v. Nelson, 1. Gray, 543; Waldron v. Bomaine, 22 N. Y. 368; Ramsey & Gore Co. v. Kelsea, 55 N. J. L. 320; Cotte v. Harden, 4 E\u00e1st. 211; Brown v. Hodgson, 2 Camp. 86; Growing v. Needham, 5 Maul\u00e9 & S. 189; 2 Kent. Com. 499; Crossman v. Lurman, 192 U. S. 189, 198.</p> <p>The sellers\u2019 act in delivering the merchandise to the common .carrier, or carrying the merchandise to -the carrier\u2019s depot (if' that is taken to be in effect alleged), is not any part' of the interstate transportation, and does not make the goods the subject of interstate commerce. Coe v. Errol, 116 U. S. 517, 528:</p> <p>The fact that the sale is made with a view to the goods being transported by the buyer\u2019s agent to another State after the sale and delivery is fully completed, does not make the sale interstate commerce.</p> <p>The sales alleged in the third paragraph of the bill, by agents of the owners in other States and Territories to whom the owners of the fresh meats have shipped the same for sale there by such agents on the ground, are not incidents of interstate commerce. Coe v. Errol, 116 U. S. 517, 525; Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U. S. 1, 23; United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1, 13, 17; Austin v. Tennessee, 179 U. S. 343; Crossman v. Lurman, 192 U. S. 189, 198; Am. Harrow Co. v. Shaffer, 58 Fed. Rep. 750; Stevens v. Ohio, 93 Fed, Rep. 793.</p> <p>Under the allegations herein question, it is to be taken that' the meats, before the sales here referred to are made, have come to their place of rest and are at rest for an indefinite time awaiting sale at their place of destination, and are a commodity in the market where the sales are made; and that the sales are not in the \"original packages\u201d; and that the meats, at the time of the sales, have become a 'part of the general property, in the State where .sold, and are there handled and sold as such.' \u25a0Southern Coal,Co. v. Bates, 156 U. S-. 577, 588; Brown v\u201e Houston, 114 U. S. 623, Q32;Emert v. Missouri, 156 U. S. 296, 310; Singer Mfg. Co. v. Wright, 97 Gdorgia, 123.</p> <p>The point here made is entirely consistent with the rulings in many cases, that the owner of merchandise, tvho transports it from one State to another for sale, has a right (which cannot be interfered with by state or municipal laws) to sell it as an article of interstate commerce. He also has a right to make such article part of the general property of the State into which it is taken, and he then has the right to sell and others have the right to purchase it as an article of domestic commerce, which cannot be interfered with- by Federal law. The Sherman Act does not seek-to and could not interfere with that right. United States v. E. C. Knight Co.,. 156 U. S. 1,15, and Kidd v. Pearson and Veazie v. Moor, there cited. But this bill here does seek to interfere with that right. Again, the point here made is not touched by the line of decisions holding that state or municipal laws are invalid, which, by taxation or other regulations, discriminate against merchandise brought from another State, or seek to prevent interstate commerce therein, \u2014such as Welton v. Missouri, 91 U. S. 465; Walling v. Michigan, 116 U. S. 446; Minnesota v. Barber, 136 U. S. 313; Brimmer v. Rebman, 138 U. S. 78, and Schollenberger v. Pennsylvania, 171 U. S. 1, 24, 25.</p> <p>The bill of complaint does not show any contract,, combination or conspiracy in restraint of interstate trade or commerce within the meaning 'of the Sherman Act.</p> <p>It does not allege any acts of defendants monopolizing or attempting to monopolize or combining or conspiring to monopoliz\u00f3 such trade or commerce.</p> <p>If the act in question be given a construction which would sustain this bill of - complaint, the statute would be unconstitutional.</p> <p>The alleged offenses complained of are set forth in the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, t\u00e9nth and eleventh paragraphs of the bill. As to the sixth and seventh paragraphs w\u00e9 maintain: The allegations of combination and conspiracy here are of mere legal conclusions. That the purchases of live stock referred to in the sixth and seventh paragraphs, as therein allegedi are not interstate commerce.</p> <p>The first paragraph of the bill in which the business of purchasing live stock for slaughter is set forth and described, does-not allege or show that the business is interstate commerce.</p> <p>The description of the. live stock in the sixth paragraph, as live stock produced and owned principally in other States and Territories, and shipped by the owners to the places where sold, for sale to persons engaged- in producing and dealing in fresh meat, does not show that the sales of, the live stock are interstate commerce. The live stock, when offered for sale in the pens of the stock yards, are, under the allegations of -fact in the bill,- to be considered as having become part of the general mass of property of the State where offered for sale. The defendants purchasing the live stock have th\u00e9 right so to treat and deal therewith. JBrown v. Houston, 114 U. S. 622, 632; Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Bates, 156 U. S. 577, 588, 589; Emert v. Missouri, 120 U. S. 489, 497: When purchased, the live stock is, under the allegations of this bill, at rest for- an indefinite time, awaiting sale at its place of destination.' Diamond Match Co. v. Ontonagon, 188 U. -S. 82, 92.</p> <p>The defendants have as much right, then, to treat and deal with and purchase such live stock as-an article of domestic commerc\u00e9 as the State has so to treat it for the purposes of taxation or regulation. . This bill seeks to interfere with that right under the Sherman Act.</p> <p>If the sworn allegations of the bill in this respect were to be supplemented by other facts, as matters of common knowledge/ with respect to the situation of the live stock when sold, such as appeared in the Hopkins and Anderson cases, the case of the Government would be no better. It Would then appear that the cattle and other live, stock are shipped to 'commission merchants at the stock yards;-are then placed in the pens of the stock yards companies, and there held, cared for and fed by the stock yards company for the account of the commission merchants, and under the .allegations here it must be taken that their bulk is broken up; they are divided into lots and sold and delivered by the commission merchant as the principal or owner thereof, and so are not purchased as articles of interstate commerce.</p> <p>But if these purchases of live stock are interstate commerce, the acts alleged in the sixth and seventh paragraphs are not violations of the Sherman Act. Hopkins v. United States, 171 U. S. 591; Anderson v. United States, 171 U. S. 604. They are the exercise of a' constitutional right of defendants to control their own business.</p> <p>There is nothing in the bill to show the proportion of the entire number of head of live stock offered for sale at the markets in question, which is bought by the defendants for the purposes of the production of fresh meat; and so there is.nothing to show anything like monopoly or attempt at monopoly of the live stock purchases by the defendants.</p> <p>There is nothing in the bill to show any attempt on the part of the defendants to control or affect the purchases or business in the purchases of live stock of any other persons than themselves. The alleged combinations by defendants in the sixth and seventh paragraphs charged have to do merely with their own business conduct in themselves buying live stock, or determining how much they shall buy, at private sale for consumption in their own' private business.</p> <p>The combination charged in the sixth paragraph, for directing their respective purchasing agents \u201cto refrain from bidding against each other, except perfunctorily, and without good faith,\u201d does not allege a combination to restrain trade; or even a combination to refrain from bidding. A perfunctory bid, made without good faith, is one which the seller could accept and enforce.</p> <p>The alleged combination in \"the seventh paragraph, \u201cfor bidding up, through their respective purchasing agents, the prices of live stock for a few days at a time at the said stock yards and open markets,\u201d does not charge a.combination to restrain trade.</p> <p>These alleged combinations do not have the direct and immediate effect of restraining interstate commerce, but their effect, if any, upon interstate trade in live stock is i\u00f1direct and incidental, within the meaning of the decisions of this court. The effect is not near so direct or immediate as the mutual agreement of the traders who were members of the Traders\u2019 Exchange in the Anderson case.</p> <p>Obviously the supply of live stock for fresh meat greatly varies in the market at different seasons and times, while the demand for fresh meats for human consumption, for which defendants purchase such live stock, is comparatively constant and uniform.</p> <p>It is a public benefit and not a public evil that defendants should always be able to supply such constant demand for their fresh, meats, and that at the same time they should not overstock the market with their perishable meats. This makes it proper that they should act with some concert and common understanding in their purchases of live stock for that purpose.</p> <p>As to the eighth paragraph we contend: The allegation of combination and conspiracy is of a mere legal conclusion, and insufficient. The sales of 'fresh meats by agents of defendants, ' as there described, under the facts alleged, are not interstate commerce. But if it be interstate commerce, no violation of the Sherman Act is thereby shown.</p> <p>No criminal conspiracy is alleged. The charge there is not of a combination or conspiracy to restrain trade (which the statute forbids), but is of a combination or conspiracy to do a lawful act, the exercise of a constitutional right, viz: to raise, lower, fix and maintain their own prices, for their own property, in private sales thereof by' themselves. The doing that is not prohibited or made criminal by the, Act of Congress.</p> <p>A criminal conspiracy is an agreement of two or more, either to do an act criminal or unlawful in itself, or to do a lawful act by means which are criminal or unlawful. Pettibone v. United States, 148 U. S. 203; Commonwealth v. Shedd, 7 Cush. 514. Here neither the act nor the means alleged are criminal or unlawful. The allegation of intent is immaterial. Stevenson v. Newham, 13 C. B. 285; Allen v. Flood, App. Cas: 1.</p> <p>Again, this point is settled , by the ruling in the Knight Case, 156 U. S. 1,16, that the restraint of trade, if any, which a combination by defendants to raise or lower their own prices would tend to effect would be.an indirect result, and such result would not necessarily determine the object of the contract, combination or conspiracy.</p> <p>As to the ninth paragraph we contend: The allegation is of a conclusion of law. The cartage as there described is not, under the allegations of the bill, interstate commerce. State v. Knight, 192 U. 8.1,21 \u00a1Detroit cfee. Ry. v. Interstate Comm. Com., 74 Fed. Rep. 803, 808; Hopkins v. United States, 171 U. S. 578, 592. The charge is not of \u00e1 conspiracy either to do a criminal or unlawful act, or to do by unlawful means the lawful act of fixing their own charges for cartage. Nothing here charged has the direct, immediate or necessary effect to restrain interstate*commerce.</p> <p>As to the tenth paragraph we maintain: The allegation is of a legal conclusion. It also is too-indefinite and general. Sufficient facts are not alleged. United States v. Hanley, 71 Fed. Rep. 672.</p> <p>\u00c1 contract or combination among manufacturers or producers of an article which is intended to become the subject of interstate commerce, to raise, lower and fix prices of such article, is not necessarily a' contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of interstate trade or an attempt to monopolize that trade under the Sherman Act. United States v. Nelson, 52 Fed. Rep. 646; In re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104; United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1, 16; Gibbs.v. McNeeley, 102 Fed. Rep. 504. See also Distillery Co. v. People, 156 Illinois, 468; Glucose Company v. Harding, 182 Illinois, 551.</p> <p>There was no jurisdiction herein of this charge. IN o common contract, combination or conspiracy of the defendants with each other is alleged. The allegation that \u201call and each\u201d have made agreements for less than lawful transportation rates is that they did so acting separately. That was not unlawful on the part of the defendants; much less was it any violation of the Sherman Anti Trust Act. There is here no sufficient .showing of an attempt to monopolize either the interstate transportation of live stock or fresh meats or interstate trade in live stock or fresh meats. The -paragraph is multifarious, and there is therein a-misjoinder of causes and parties.</p> <p>As to the eleventh paragraph we submit that it is too general and insufficient to require argument. It is disposed of by what has been urged as to previous paragraphs.</p> <p>Prior rulings by this court in cases arising under the Sherman Act do not sustain the Government\u2019s case here.</p> <p>With respect to the supposed limitations of the Sherman Act upon the right of private contract, that act is to be interpreted in the light of the principles of.'the common law. United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649; Moore v. United States, 91 U. S. 270, 274; Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162; Ex'parte Wilson, 114 U. S. 417, 422; Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 624; Smith v. Alabama, 124 U. S. 465.\u2019</p> <p>The bill of complaint is multifarious; and there is therein a. misjoinder of causes and of parties. Walker v. Powers., 104 U. S. 251; Brown v. Guarantee Trust Company, 128 TJ. S. 403; Zeigler v. Lake Street Railway, 76 Fed. Rep. 662.</p> <p>The bill is too general and indefinite to require answer.

Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 194; Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U. S. 197, 337. If interstate commerce is commerce which concerns more States than one, and if a combination of independent producers to suppress competition between its members is a restraint upon commerce, it must follow that a combination of independent producers to fix and control- prices and suppress- competition between each other in an area covering more States than one is in .restraint of interstate commerce and the petition in this case discloses such a combination.</p> <p>\u25a0 It is impossible to say with even a color of reason that the facts stated in the bill, which cannot be denied, do not show a combination between the defendants to suppress competition between themselves in an area embracing more States than one and it is immaterial to inquire whether the particular purchases and sales made by the defendants are, technically, interstate or intrastate transactions. There is nothing unreasonable or novel in the conclusion that a combination may restrain interstate commerce, although the individual transactions. of its members might, standing alone and viewed separate and apart from the purpose and necessary effect of the whole combination, be intrastate in character. Montague & Co. v. Lomy, 193 U. S. 38.- The character of a combination \u2022 \u2014that is, whether or not it is interstate in its operation- \u2014 is decided, not by the nature of the particular transactions of its individual members, but by the extent of- the territory in which it operates \u2014 in which it controls prices and sales and suppresses competition. If that territory embraces more States than one the combination restrains interstate commerce.' Addyston .Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, 175 U. S. 211, 240.</p> <p>Whether a combination in restraint of trade operates upon interstate or only intrastate commerce does not depend ppon whether the individual transactions of its members, standing alone and viewed separate and apart from the purpose and necessary effect of- the whole combination, are interstate or intrastate in character, and the petition here discloses a combination which operates upon interstate commerce; for whatever may be the character of the individual transactions of its several members, it is also true in this case that the individual -transactions of the members of the combination do fall within the jurisdiction conferred upon Congress by the commerce clause of the Constitution. These transactions consist of the defendants\u2019 purchases of live stock; the sales and shipments of fresh meats made directly \u2022by'1 the defendants to dealers and consumers in the several States, and the sales of fresh meats to dealers and consumers in the several States by agents of the defendants located in those States.</p> <p>From all over the stock-raising section, embracing many different States, cattle, sheep and hogs are habitually shipped to the great live-stock markets at Chicago, Omaha, Sioux City, St. Joseph, Kansas City, East St. Louis and St. Paul for sale, to those, the defendants chief among th\u00e9m, engaged in the business of converting live stock into fresh meats for human consumption. The shipments are made with the express'and' sole purpose of sale as soon as market conditions will permit, and the sales are made while the cattle yet remain in first hands, that is,. in the hands of the owners or th'eir agents, and in the ordinary form or condition in which cattle are shipped from one country or State to another, which is analogous to the form or condition of the original package in the case of merchandise. Austin vi Tennessee, 179 U. S. 343, '359.</p> <p>The cattle are not dealt with in a commercial way from the time of their arrival until their sale to the defendants and others, but are simply fed and cared for. No act is done with reference to them that would cause them to become mixed with the general mass of local property. Now, it may be that a distinction should be made between what may be called an interstate-sale proper, and in the full sense of the term \u2014 that is, a sale between persons negotiating and dealing from two or more different States, and a sale, at its destination and while it still remains in the original state or package, of an article of commerce sent from another State. But so far as the result in this instance is concerned it is a distinction without a difference. If the sales of live stock set forth in the petition do not fall within the first of these classes they certainly fall within the second, and that brings them within the protection of the Federal power over commerce and therefore within the protection of the Anti Trust Act; for the right to transport articles of commerce from one State to another includes the right of the owner or consignee to sell them in\u2019 the latter free from any burden or restraint that the States might attempt to impose. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419; Bowman v. Chicago and Northwestern Railway Co., 125 U. S. 465; Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S. 100; Rhodes v. Iowa, 170 U. S. 412, and, a fortiori, free from any burden or restraint that a combination .of individuals might attempt to impose. In re\"Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 581; Hopkins v. United /States, 171 U. S. 578, 590.</p> <p>Paragraph 2 of the bill contains matter of description and inducement, and must be read in conjunction with the stating part of the petition, which alleges, inter alia, that \u201cin order to restrain and destroy competition- among themselves \u201d the defendants have engaged in a \u201ccombination and conspiracy to arbitrarily from time to time raise, lower, and fix prices, and to maintain uniform prices at which they will sell, directly or through their respective agents; such fresh meats to dealers and consumers throughout the said States and Territories and the District of Columbia and foreign countries.\u201d</p> <p>As the sales made directly by the defendants to dealers and consumers throughout the United States are interstate sales, and as decisions of this' court have settled that a combination to control and suppress competition in such sales is a combination in restraint of interstate commerce, the petition in this case, having shown that much, cannot in any event be dismissed, even should it be held to have failed in all other respects.</p> <p>Paragraph 3 of the petition states that the defendants are engaged in shipping fresh meats from their plants in certain States to their respective agents at and. near the principal markets in other States and Territories for sale by such agents to dealers and consumers in those States and Territories. Upon the question whether or not the' sales made by these agents under the circumstances set forth are within the body of interstate commerce, there is nothing to add to the cogent argument in the opinion of the circuit judge.</p> <p>The bill is not multifarious and does not disclose a mis-joinder of parties. 14 Ency. of PL and Pr. 198; 1 Bates Fed. Eq. Pro. \u00a7\u00a7 135, 195. The Circuit Court did not err in sustaining the demurrers to the bill in its aspect as a bill of discovery. The demurrers are demurrers to the whole bill. Livingston v. Story, 9 Pet. 632, 654.</p> <p>The well-settled rule of equity pleading is that a demurrer to a whole bill cannot be sustained as to part of the bill and overruled as to part, but must be overruled as to the whole if any part \u00f3f the bill is good and entitles the complainant to any relief. Fletcher, Eq. PL \u00a7\u00a7 203, 204; Story, Eq. PL, 10th ed., \u00a7\u00a7 443, 444; Parker v. Simpson, 62 N. E. Rep. (Mass.) 401; Metier\u2019s Admn\u2019s. v. Metier, 18 N. J. Eq. 270, 273. When the defendants leveled their demurrers at the relief as well as the discovery, instead of answering as to the relief and demurring as to the discovery they did so at their p\u00e9ril. Daniell\u2019s Chari. Prat\u00ed., 3d Am. ed., 568-608; see also Acts of Congress of'February 25, 1903, 32 Stat. 903; of February 11, 1893, 27 Stat. 443, and Interstate Comm. Com. v. Baird, 194 U. S. 25, 44, citing Brown v. Walker', 161 U. S. 591; Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616.</p> <p>Judges have differed as to the validity of aggregations of capital effected by some form of organic union between several smaller and competing corporations, and economists are far from agreeing that such aggregations, within limitations, are hurtful. So- too, associations of manufacturers to regulate competition within a restricted area have not always been condemned by courts and have sometimes been approved by publicists. But as yet no responsible voice has been heard to justify, legally or economically, a conspiracy or agreement between nearly all the producers of a commodity necessary to life by which the confederates acquire absolute control and dominion over the production, sale and distribution of that commodity throughout the entire territory of a nation, with the power, at will, to raise prices to the consumer of'the finished product and lower prices to the- producer of the raw material. Yet such is that now at the bar of this court. That there is a conspiracy to control the market of the nation for fresh meats, that it does control it, and that its control is merciless and oppressive, are. facts known of all men. The broad question here is, Does the Government\u2019s petition, with its statements of fact standing unchallenged, discover that conspiracy to the court? We submit that it does and that the decree of the Circuit Court should in all things be affirmed.</p>",

These transactions consist of the defendants\u2019 purchases of live stock; the sales and shipments of fresh meats made directly \u2022by'1 the defendants to dealers and consumers in the several States, and the sales of fresh meats to dealers and consumers in the several States by agents of the defendants located in those States.\n   </summary><br><summary id=\"b413-6\">\n    From all over the stock-raising section, embracing many different States, cattle, sheep and hogs are habitually shipped to the great live-stock markets at Chicago, Omaha, Sioux City, St. Joseph, Kansas City, East St. Louis and St. Paul for sale, to those, the defendants chief among th\u00e9m, engaged in the business of converting live stock into fresh meats for human consumption. The shipments are made with the express'and' sole purpose of sale as soon as market conditions will permit, and the sales are made while the cattle yet remain in first hands, that is,. in the hands of the owners or th'eir agents, and in the ordinary form or condition in which cattle are shipped from one country or State to another, which is analogous to the form or condition of the original package in the case of merchandise.\n    <em>\n     Austin\n    </em>\n    vi\n    <em>\n     Tennessee,\n    </em>\n    179 U.

No act is done with reference to them that would cause them to become mixed with the general mass of local property. Now, it may be that a distinction should be made between what may be called an interstate-sale proper, and in the full sense of the term \u2014 that is, a sale between persons negotiating and dealing from two or more different States, and a sale, at its destination and while it still remains in the original state or package, of an article of commerce sent from another State. But so far as the result in this instance is concerned it is a distinction without a difference. If the sales of live stock set forth in the petition do not fall within the first of these classes they certainly fall within the second, and that brings them within the protection of the Federal power over commerce and therefore within the protection of the Anti Trust Act; for the right to transport articles of commerce from one State to another includes the right of the owner or consignee to sell them in\u2019 the latter free from any burden or restraint that the States might attempt to impose.\n    <em>\n     Brown\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Maryland,\n    </em>\n    12 Wheat. 419;\n    <em>\n     Bowman\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Chicago and Northwestern Railway Co.,\n    </em>\n    125 U.

So- too, associations of manufacturers to regulate competition within a restricted area have not always been condemned by courts and have sometimes been approved by publicists. But as yet no responsible voice has been heard to justify, legally or economically, a conspiracy or agreement between nearly all the producers of a commodity necessary to life by which the confederates acquire absolute control and dominion over the production, sale and distribution of that commodity throughout the entire territory of a nation, with the power, at will, to raise prices to the consumer of'the finished product and lower prices to the- producer of the raw material. Yet such is that now at the bar of this court. That there is a conspiracy to control the market of the nation for fresh meats, that it does control it, and that its control is merciless and oppressive, are. facts known of all men. The broad question here is, Does the Government\u2019s petition, with its statements of fact standing unchallenged, discover that conspiracy to the court?
